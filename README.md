## HI, HOW ARE YOU?

A short film about time, repetition, and memory, shot within 30 minutes.
This player is part of the work—not a wrapper around it. It treats viewing as an act of co‑composition: the film loops, the interface listens, and the audience shapes tempo.

## Why a looping player

Time travel in cinema is usually dramatic; here it is domestic. Repetition is not spectacle but practice—the way a moment returns until we finally hear IT. Looping becomes a way to re‑enter a scene, to notice a new inflection, and to feel the edge where familiarity turns uncanny.

## What the interface does (as a gesture, not a feature list)

- The play/pause is an invitation to stay with a moment longer.
- Segment loops accumulate like memories: each return is THE SAME and not the same.
- Tempo shifts mirror lived perception—how attention speeds up when we anticipate, and slows when we dwell. Manual control allows care; automatic acceleration reflects the restless pull of recall.
- The progress bar measures breath, not completion. It tracks an individual loop rather than a linear journey.

## Agency and surrender

The player offers control but resists total mastery. You can steer speed and choose an entry point, yet the system also decides when to revisit and when to move on. This tension is the piece: a soft negotiation between intention and drift, authorship and accident.

## A note on attention

“Hi, how are you?” is a small question that asks for a large answer. If you let it, the repetition becomes a form of care but also poke: not demanding novelty, only presence.

## How to experience it

- Start anywhere. Loops are designed to be porous and re‑enterable.
- Adjust speed if you need to breathe with the image. Or let it carry you; acceleration will arrive on its own.
- Take the last loop as a landing, not an ending.

## Gratitude
