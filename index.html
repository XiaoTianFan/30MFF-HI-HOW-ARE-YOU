                        <p>A short film about time, repetition, and memory, shot within 30 minutes. This player is part of the work—not a wrapper around it. It treats viewing as an act of co‑composition: the film loops, the interface listens, and the audience shapes tempo.</p>
                        <p>Time travel in cinema is usually dramatic; here it is domestic. Repetition is not spectacle but practice—the way a moment returns until we finally hear IT. Looping becomes a way to re‑enter a scene, to notice a new inflection, and to feel the edge where familiarity turns uncanny.</p>
                        <p>The player offers control but resists total mastery. You can steer speed and choose an entry point, yet the system also decides when to revisit and when to move on. This tension is the piece: a soft negotiation between intention and drift, authorship and accident.</p>
                        <p>“Hi, how are you?” is a small question that asks for a large answer. If you let it, the repetition becomes a form of care but also poke: not demanding novelty, only presence.</p>
                        <p>Made for ComLab. With thanks to the people who asked the question and stayed to watch.</p>
